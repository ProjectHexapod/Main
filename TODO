Firmware:
  rename all the device overlays

Hardware:
  Ignition switch
  Design engine control board
    - pump bypass valves
      - two PWM's 
    - hydraulic temperature sensor
    - engine temperature sensor
    - tachometer
    - alternator control???
    - Throttle servo
    - ignition
  Port documentation to wiki
  Determine whether to use central 12V reg or chip on CoS
  3D print magnetic encoder enclosures
  Build manual override controller
  Put together main computer
  Get a networking switch
  Get a fuse box
  Get a hard E-stop switch
  Plan out soft E-stop switch
    - Remote buttons - garage door openers?
    - Big Red Button for console
    - USB keyboard input to main computer?

  Cape of Stomping Redesign
    - Pick new resitor values for ADC dividers 
      - See Brett's email
    - Check 12V divider too
    - 

  Cape of Stomping Schematic updates
    - Done!

  Cape of Stomping PCB updates
    - Fix inductor footprint - missing bottom pads
    - Space diodes out more
    - Space FET's out more
    - C12 pads should extend farther from the part
    - Add polarity markers to giant surface mount cap footprints (C12, C13)
    - Power connector footprint needs shape polarity mark
    - Power connector needs room on sides for mating connector tabs
    - J1 Solenoid connector footprint is wrong - far row of holes too close

  Magnetic Encoder board PCB updates
    - Make board 1.5" x 1.5"
    - Move sensor to dead center
    - Add mounting holes
    - Change to 5 pair connector
    - Update routing
    - Submit PCB order
    - Submit parts order 

Software:
  pull out the deadband parameters from closed loop test
  centralize all the parameters, a model file probably
  determine how to do calibration and document it
  write calibration scripts
  make realtime graphing (over the network)  (maybe graphite?)
  start thinking about interfacing with the existing code
  start thinking about a UI  (LOW)
  document a comm protocol
  hook up all the networking code
  do the physics
  add force inputs to BBB code
  import the gate code and the IK
  import the joystick code
  enforce speed ramps at all times
  port SoftStopAwareSpeedManager to python, integrate
  make E stop
  write server code
<<<<<<< HEAD
  Make sure dithering is implemented

=======
  get SPI working and reading magnetic encoders
  translate joystick input into gait commands (existing code?)
  throttle control 
  pump control
  fan control
  Calibration for magnetic encoders
  Talk to IMU (existing code?)
  Calibrate IMU
