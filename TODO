Firmware:
  rename all the device overlays

Hardware:
  Critical:
    Wire up the rest of the legs  
      - Connect power and ethernet  
    Install network switch  
      - Put in sealed enclosure inside console?  
    Soft E-stop button for console  
    Main computer cape  
      - specify pilot control inputs  
      - specify dashboard indicator outputs  
    Manual pump bypass valves (until engine controller board is done)  

  Non-critical:  
    Ignition switch  
    Design engine control board  
      - pump bypass valves  
        - one PWM each  
      - Throttle servo  
      - hydraulic temperature sensor  
      - hydraulic pressur sensor  
      - hydraulic flow sensor?  
      - engine temperature sensor  
      - tachometer  
      - alternator control???  
    Build manual valve controller pendant   
      - Connectors for knee, thigh, and hip solenoids  
      - toggle switches to manually move each joint  


Software:
  pull out the deadband parameters from closed loop test
  centralize all the parameters, a model file probably
  determine how to do calibration and document it
  write calibration scripts
  make realtime graphing (over the network)  (maybe graphite?)
  start thinking about interfacing with the existing code
  start thinking about a UI  (LOW)
  document a comm protocol
  hook up all the networking code
  do the physics
  add force inputs to BBB code
  import the gate code and the IK
  import the joystick code
  enforce speed ramps at all times
  port SoftStopAwareSpeedManager to python, integrate
  make E stop
  write server code
  Make sure dithering is implemented
  get SPI working and reading magnetic encoders
  translate joystick input into gait commands (existing code?)
  throttle control 
  pump control
  fan control
  Calibration for magnetic encoders
  Talk to IMU (existing code?)
  Calibrate IMU 

Documentation:
  Check leg enclosure port locations
    Top:
      Solenoids
      larger (power/ethernet)
      
    Bottom:
  Design engine control board
    - pump bypass valves
      - two PWM's 
    - hydraulic temperature sensor
    - engine temperature sensor
    - tachometer
    - alternator control???
    - Throttle servo
    - ignition
      String pots
      smaller (power/ethernet)

  Check cable types 
  Check compliant link sensor voltage level

Hydraulic flow rate sensor?  
  - Should we have an electronic flow rate sensor as a critical step?
