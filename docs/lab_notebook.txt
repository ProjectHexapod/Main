Test: 
Check PWM output to solenoid against current feedback using scope

Result: 
PWM was a clean square wave
Feedback was a sawtooth wave correlating with the PWM

Takeaway:
There is no filtering built into the current feedback
------------------------

------------------------
Test: 
Figure out how high of a PWM frequency we need to go to in order to get a clean DCish signal back from current feedback due to filtering from solenoid inductance 

Notes:
Set PWM to 20kHz, 50% duty cycle 
Saw no current output

Set PWM to 2kHz, 50% duty cycle 
Works fine
Scope on current feedback shows clean triangle wave with roughly 150mV pk-pk, 100mV DC offset

Set PWM to 10kHz, 50% duty cycle 
No output

Discovered broken alligator clip wire causing flaky connection

Try again to set PWM to 20kHz, 50% duty cycle 
PWM output is a nice clean square wave
Current feedback is around 100mV with small ripple, but high voltage short duration spikes on transitions
Software reads 230mV, jumping around between 211-255mV (525 mV per amp)

At 20kHz 40% duty cycle, we got 500mA measured using handheld DMM scope
Current feedback was ~50mV - expected ~250mV

At 20kHz, 100% duty cycle
1.44A coil current measured with DMM
Expect 756mV (1.44A * 525 mV/A)
Current feedback was 0.7V.  
Software reads 1.5V, jumping around between 1474-1511 mV

Check 20kHz, 40% duty cycle again
Expect 264mV 
Current feedback is ~50mV according to scope
Sanity check the oscilliscope with multimeter (DC voltage) - get 60.9mV 
DMM measures 503mA 
Software reads 98-133mV 


Measure Beaglebone cape analog ground to Stompy system ground (at screw terminal in controller box) - 10mV
Beaglebone digital ground and analog ground are the same

Discovered that the motor controller has a 338Hz -3dB cutoff frequency (R = 200 Ohm, C = 0.47uF)

Try attaching a 470uF capacitor to current feedback to see if it cleans up signal
	Power supply started current limiting when we went to hook it up so we killed power

Check 20kHz, 50% duty cycle 
Find coil impedance @20kHz
Power supply is at 12V
DMM measures PWM current at 0.64A

8.5VRMS/0.64A = 13.3 Ohms

Check 20kHz, 25% duty cycle
DMM measures 0.28A
Predict 451mA (6 VRMS/13.3 Ohms)

Check 20kHz, 75% duty cycle
DMM measures 0.86A
Predict 777mA (10.35 VRMS/13.3 Ohms)

Test:  
Bench setup:
1 Ohm 3Watt resistor in series with solenoid coil on ground side
Scope has one channel across resistor to measure current, and one channel on current FB from motor controller

Try 20kHz, 50% duty cycle
Power supply shows 0.35A currrent draw
Get very clean square wave across resistor - 1.3A peak
Current sense shows 0.12V => 0.23A
Arduino reads 0.25A

Try 20kHz, 25% duty cycle
Power supply shows 0.10A currrent draw
Get very clean square wave across resistor - 1.3A peak
Current sense is in the noise.  Noise is around 0.02V. ~0.01V => 0.02A
Arduino reads 0.02A

Try 20kHz, 75% duty cycle
Power supply shows 0.78A currrent draw
Get very clean square wave across resistor - 1.3A peak
Current sense shows 0.35V=> 0.67A
Arduino reads 0.65A


Result:
Graphed results and added polynomial trendline.  Equation came out to Ifb = 1.4*(duty)^2 - 0.15*(duty) - 0.025
This predicts that Ifb for a 65% duty cycle would be:
1.4*(0.65)^2 - 0.15*(0.65) - 0.025 = 0.47A

Try 20kHz, 65% duty cycle
Power supply shows 0.55 currrent draw
Get very clean square wave across resistor - 1.3A peak
Current sense shows 0.20V=> 0.38A
Arduino reads 0.42A

Polynomial approximation failed to accurately model results

Goal: 
Characterize current feedback against actual current

Setup:
Use resistive load to remove nonlinearities and frequency dependent impedence factors

1.18 Ohm load with a 14V PWM supply
At 10% duty cycle (max for this test) this produces 1.19A average

Vrms = peak * sqrt(duty cycle) = 14* sqrt(0.10) = 4.427 Vrms
Prms = Vrms^2 / R = 4.427^2 / 1.18 Ohms = 16.6W
Prms = (peak * sqrt(duty cycle))^2 / R
3% duty cycle => 4.98W 
so it looks like for our 5W 1.18 Ohm resistor the max PWM at 14V is 3% duty cycle

Using average current not RMS current for these calculations because the field strength is proportional to current, not power.  I'm not 100% sure this is the right approach, but it sounds right.
