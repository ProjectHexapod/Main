I provide this library free for use in any setting, be it free or otherwise.


I do have a few requests:

1: Most importantly, do not take credit for this library--that would be wrong, and not true, you know?  Citing me somewhere is enough--leaving the CREDITS.txt file in glLib/ will do.  

2: I'm fine with you using code from this library to construct your own code.  Here, mentioning me is nice, but not required.  However, if you're ripping functions and stuff, you can't really say it's your work.  Also, if you're cannibalizing stuff from my library, I'm not responsible if you can't get it to work.  

3: As an optional aside, you can tell me where you used this--I wanna know where it ends up!
