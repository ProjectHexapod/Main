	* declarations.pyx, world.pyp: expose linear/angular damping
	  controls. Patch by Tristam MacDonald.

2008-12-23  Ethan Glasser-Camp  <ethan.glasser.camp@gmail.com>

	* setup.py: Compiling against new ODE. Needs to use ode-config to
	get CFLAGS and LIBS (for example, to tell if we're compiling with
	-DdDOUBLE).
	* ode.pyx, declarations.pyx: Compiling against new ODE requires
	dInitODE to initialize colliders.
	* Renamed __new__ to __cinit__ for the new version of Pyrex.

2008-12-21  Ethan Glasser-Camp  <ethan.glasser.camp@gmail.com>

	* space.pyx: Rebuilding with new Pyrex gives an error with parameter
	  "type". Renamed to "space_type" in Space factory method.

2007-07-09  Ethan Glasser-Camp  <ethan.glasser.camp@gmail.com>

	* tutorial3.py: change glScale to glScalef to be compatible with
	  python-opengl version 3.0 and up. Thanks to Nathanial Troutman for
	  finding the bug and suggesting a fix.

2007-06-16  Ethan Glasser-Camp  <ethan.glasser.camp@gmail.com>

	* ode.pyx: reapplied weakref patch after finding the bug
	* tutorial3.py: fix bug where geoms were not stored, causing them
	  to be deleted as per the weakref patch :)

2007-06-14  Ethan Glasser-Camp  <ethan.glasser.camp@gmail.com>

	* heightfielddata.pyx: bug fix from Dan Miller
	* Reverted weakref patch -- it causes some kind of strange
	  bug. I'll look into it later.
	* heightfielddata.pyx: Save a reference to the data tuple, because
	  otherwise it gets garbage collected and causes problems. Thanks
	  to Dan Miller for finding the bug and figuring it out.
	
2007-06-05  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Applied a couple of patches posted by Ethan Glasser-Camp to the 
	  mailing list (doc strings for GeomRay, __delattr__ on
	  GeomObject, UniversalJoint angle updates, storing
	  Geoms with weak references, triangle count)
	* Added the heightfield patch as well

2006-11-28  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* setup.py: Modified the setup script to upgrade to ODE 0.7.
	
2006-11-10  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* joints.pyx, geoms.pyx: Applied some more patches by 
	  Ethan Glasser-Camp (switched from the ccylinder functions to
	  the capsule functions and renamed the GeomCCylinder to GeomCapsule.
	  For backwards compatibility, the name GeomCCylinder is still
	  available and is an alias for GeomCapsule. Added support for
	  GeomCylinder (the uncapped one)).

2006-11-09  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* joints.pyx: Applied a patch from the mailing list that adds support
	  for the LMotor (thanks to Ethan Glasser-Camp).
	* joints.pyx: Applied a patch from the mailing list that adds support
	  for the Plane2DJoint (thanks to Leonard Ritter).

	These changes requires a more recent version of ODE than 0.5 
	(I've switched to v0.7 now).

2006-08-15  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* joints.pyx: The JointGroup.__dealloc__() method now notifies
	  the contained joints about the destruction of the ODE joints
	  (i.e. _destroyed() is called).

2006-05-30  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mass.pyx: Applied Chris Bainbridge's patch that adds the 
	  Mass.setBoxTotal() method, and while I was at it I added
	  the other set*Total() methods, too.

2006-04-13  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* space.pyx, joints.pyx: Fixed some doc strings that generated
	  epydoc warnings.
	* ode.pyx: Added the collide2() function (and fixed some more doc
	  strings).
	
2006-01-17  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* geomobject.pyx: Added the getQuaternion()/setQuaternion() methods

2005-12-16  Timothy Stranex <timothy.stranex@gmail.com>
	* setup.py: Modified setup to look for ODE installations in common
	  locations.
	* examples/tutorial3.py: Updated with Pierre Gay's changes so that it
	  does not depend on cgkit or pygame.
	* tests/test_xode.py: Fixed some instances of testing floats for
	  equality.

2005-09-20  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ode.pyx: Added the ParamX3 parameter names and the ParamGroup definition

2005-06-24  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Modified the base joint class so that its possible to store 
	  arbitrary attributes (as is the case with regular Python classes).
	  This was suggested in "bug" 1121141.

2005-06-06  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Creating a Body now requires a World object. Empty Bodies are not
	  allowed anymore. The ode.environment object now simply holds None
	  instead of an empty Body. It's now also possible to pass None to
	  the attach() method.
	* Added an iterator to iterate over the geoms inside a Space.

2005-05-05  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src\joints.pyx (Joints): Added methods to set joint forces/torques directly (section 7.6
	  in the ODE manual).

2005-03-03  Matthias Baas <mbaas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src\geomobject.pyx (setCollideBits, setCategoryBits): Bits can now also be passed as int.
	  Updated doc about collide and category bits (which are actually long instead of int).

2004-11-30  Timothy Stranex <timothy@stranex.com>

	* Modified setup to work with both Trimesh-enabled and Trimesh-disabled
	  builds of ODE without needing Pyrex to be installed.
